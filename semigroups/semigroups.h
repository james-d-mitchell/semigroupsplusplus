    //! * \p relation is a vector consisting of a libsemigroups::letter_t and a
    //! libsemigroups::letter_t such that
    //! Semigroup::gens(\c relation[\c 0]) ==
    //! Semigroup::gens(\c relation[\c 1]), i.e. if the
    //! semigroup was defined with duplicate generators;
    //!
    //! * \p relation is a vector consisting of a libsemigroups::pos_t,
    //! libsemigroups::letter_t, and libsemigroups::pos_t such that
    //! \code{.cpp}
    //!   this[relation[0]] * Semigroup::gens(relation[1]) == this[relation[2]]
    //! \endcode
    //!
    //! * \p relation is empty if there are no more relations.
    //!
    //! Semigroup::next_relation is guaranteed to output all relations of
    //! length 2 before any relations of length 3. If called repeatedly after
    //! Semigroup::reset_next_relation, and until relation is empty, the values
    //! placed in \p relation correspond to a length-reducing confluent
    //! rewriting system that defines the semigroup.
    //!
    //! This method can be used in conjunction with Semigroup::factorisation to
