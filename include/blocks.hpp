  //! Blocks is a class representing signed partitions of the set
  //! \f$\{0, \ldots, n - 1\}\f$.
  //!
  //! It is possible to associate to every Bipartition a pair of blocks,
  //! Bipartition::left_blocks and Bipartition::right_blocks, which determine
  //! the Green's \f$\mathscr{L}\f$- and \f$\mathscr{R}\f$-classes of the
  //! Bipartition in the monoid of all bipartitions. This is the purpose of this
  //! class.
  //!
  //! The Blocks class is not currently used by any of the functions for the
  //! FroidurePin class but the extra functions are used in the GAP package
  //! [Semigroups package for GAP](https://gap-packages.github.io/Semigroups/).
