### by [J. D. Mitchell](http://www-groups.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~jamesm/) and [M. Torpey](http://www-circa.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~mct25/) 
with contributions by [J. Jonusas](http://www-circa.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~julius/),

and [N. Thiery](http://nicolas.thiery.name)

The current version of libsemigroups is 0.6.3.

libsemigroups is a C++ library for semigroups and monoids using C++11; it is
partly based on [Algorithms for computing finite
semigroups](https://www.irif.fr/~jep/PDF/Rio.pdf), [Expository
Slides](https://www.irif.fr/~jep/PDF/Exposes/StAndrews.pdf), and [Semigroupe
2.01](https://www.irif.fr/~jep/Logiciels/Semigroupe2.0/semigroupe2.html) by
Jean-Eric Pin. 
libsemigroups uses
[catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) for its unit tests.

The libsemigroups library is used in the 
[Semigroups package for GAP](http://gap-packages.github.io/Semigroups/).
The development version is available on 
[Github](https://github.com/james-d-mitchell/libsemigroups), and there are
[python bindings](http://github.com/james-d-mitchell/libsemigroups-python-bindings/) (for Python 2 and 3). 

Some of the features of 
[Semigroupe 2.01](https://www.irif.fr/~jep/Logiciels/Semigroupe2.0/semigroupe2.html) 
are not yet implemented in libsemigroups, this is a work in
progress. Missing features include those for:

* Green's relations, or classes
* finding a zero
* minimal ideal, principal left/right ideals, or indeed any ideals
* inverses
* local submonoids
* the kernel
* variety tests.

These will be included in a future version. 

libsemigroups performs roughly the same as 
[Semigroupe 2.01](https://www.irif.fr/~jep/Logiciels/Semigroupe2.0/semigroupe2.html)
when there is a known upper bound on the size of the semigroup being
enumerated, and this is used to initialise the data structures for the
semigroup; see libsemigroups::Semigroup::reserve for more
details. Note that in 
[Semigroupe 2.01](https://www.irif.fr/~jep/Logiciels/Semigroupe2.0/semigroupe2.html)
it is always necessary to provide such an upper bound, but in libsemigroups
it is not. 

libsemigroups also has some advantages over 
[Semigroupe 2.01](https://www.irif.fr/~jep/Logiciels/Semigroupe2.0/semigroupe2.html):

* there is a (hopefully) convenient C++ API, which makes it relatively easy to
  create and manipulate semigroups and monoids
* there are some multithreaded methods for semigroups and their congruences
* you do not have to know/guess the size of a semigroup or monoid before you
  begin
* libsemigroups supports more types of elements than 
[Semigroupe 2.01](https://www.irif.fr/~jep/Logiciels/Semigroupe2.0/semigroupe2.html)
* it is relatively straightforward to add support for further types of elements
  and semigroups
* it is possible to enumerate a certain number of elements of a semigroup or
  monoid (say if you are looking for an element with a particular property), to
  stop, and then to start the enumeration again at a later point
* you can instantiate as many semigroups and monoids as you can fit in memory
* it is possible to add more generators after a semigroup or monoid has been
  constructed, without losing or having to recompute any information that was
  previously known
* libsemigroups contains rudimentary implementations of the
  [Todd-Coxeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd–Coxeter_algorithm) and
  [Knuth-Bendix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth–Bendix_completion_algorithm)
  algorithms for finitely presented semigroups, which can also be used to
  compute congruences of a (not necessarily finitely presented) semigroup or
  monoid.

## Installation

### Installing with conda

This installation method assumes that you have anaconda or miniconda
installed. See the [getting started](https://conda.io/docs/get-started.html)
and [miniconda download page](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
on the [conda](https://conda.io/) website.

Activate the [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.github.io/) package repository:

    conda config --add channels conda-forge

Install libsemigroups

    conda install libsemigroups

### From the sources

libsemigroups requires a C++ compiler supporting the C++11 standard.
To install libsemigroups from the sources (this also requires `autoconf` and
`automake`): 

    git clone https://github.com/james-d-mitchell/libsemigroups
    cd libsemigroups
    ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && sudo make install

To enable assertions and other debugging checks enabled do:

    ./autogen.sh && ./configure --enable-debug && make && sudo make install

## Documentation
The documentation is generated using
[doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org) and is available
[here](http://james-d-mitchell.github.io/libsemigroups/).
This documentation can be compiled by running `./autogen.sh && ./configure &&
make doc` in the `libsemigroups` directory, and the tests can be run by doing
`make check` in the `libsemigroups`
directory.

## Python bindings
There are 
[python bindings](http://github.com/james-d-mitchell/libsemigroups-python-bindings/) (for Python 2 and 3) for most of the functionality of libsemigroups. 

## Issues
If you find any problems with libsemigroups, or have any suggestions for features
