To run the benchmarks in this directory you should ensure that you have the
prerequisites install (see below), and then do:

    ./autogen.sh ; ./configure ; make ; sudo make install
    benchmark/benchmark.sh

in the libsemigroups directory. 

This produces some files in json format in the directory
libsemigroups/benchmark/logs, and you can compare the output in two files by
doing:

    benchmark/compare_bench.py <json_file1> <json_file2> 

in the libsemigroups directory.

PREREQUISITES

For the above to work you should follow the steps below.

1) Ensure that cmake (version 3.5 or higher) is installed. 

   On a debian-like operating system this do:
    
       sudo apt-get install cmake

   On Mac OSX do:

       brew install cmake

2) Install google benchmark:

    https://github.com/google/benchmark

by doing the following (somewhere probably outside the libsemigroups folder):

    git clone https://github.com/google/benchmark
    cd benchmark
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  .
    make 
    sudo make install
