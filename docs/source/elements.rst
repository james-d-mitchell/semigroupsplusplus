Elements
========

This page contains an overview summary of the functionality in
``libsemigroups`` for defining elements of semigroups. 

HPCombi
~~~~~~~

If ``libsemigroups`` is compiled with HPCombi_ support enabled (see
:ref:`Installation` for details), then the types defined in HPCombi_ (which use the
SSE and AVX instruction sets for very fast manipulation of these types) can be
used with the algorithms in ``libsemigroups``; for further details see
the HPCombi_ documentation.

The struct templates: 

- :cpp:any:`libsemigroups::BMatHelper`
- :cpp:any:`libsemigroups::PermHelper`
- :cpp:any:`libsemigroups::PPermHelper`
- :cpp:any:`libsemigroups::TransfHelper`

can be used to get the smallest/fastest type representing a boolean matrix,
permutation, partial permutation, or transformation, and can be used
independently of whether or not ``libsemigroups`` is compiled with HPCombi_
support enabled.
